# Getting Started with MERN Stack

## Overview

The **MERN stack** is a popular JavaScript-based web development stack used for building full-stack web applications. It consists of:
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: A lightweight backend framework for Node.js that simplifies API creation.
- **React**: A frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server.

This stack enables developers to use a single language (JavaScript) for both the frontend and backend, making it easier to develop and maintain full-stack applications.

- [ ] Learn how to install and run MongoDB locally.
- [ ] Understand how to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) documents in MongoDB.
- [ ] Learn MongoDB query language and basic aggregation.

### 3. Express.js
- [ ] Learn how to set up a basic **Node.js** server.
- [ ] Install and configure **Express.js**.
- [ ] Create routes for handling HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- [ ] Understand **middleware** and how it works in Express.
- [ ] Learn how to connect Express to MongoDB using **Mongoose**.

### 4. React

- [ ] Implement basic error handling for API calls.

### 6. Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Learn how to implement user authentication (signup, login) using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
- [ ] Understand how to handle protected routes in both Express and React.
- [ ] Learn about storing JWT securely (localStorage, cookies).

### 7. Deployment
- [ ] Learn how to deploy your **backend** (Node.js + Express) to a cloud provider (Heroku, Vercel, etc.).
- [ ] Learn how to deploy your **frontend** (React) to a static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel).
- [ ] Connect your deployed frontend to your deployed backend.

### 8. Advanced Topics (Optional)
- [ ] Explore advanced React concepts (React Query, React Lazy/Suspense).
- [ ] Learn advanced MongoDB topics (indexing, transactions, and replication).
- [ ] Understand how to use WebSockets for real-time communication.
- [ ] Learn how to write unit and integration tests for your application.
