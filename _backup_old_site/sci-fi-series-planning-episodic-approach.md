## Outline for the First Book

For the first book, aim for a **5,000–10,000-word short story** that introduces your protagonist and sci-fi world while delivering a standalone adventure. Use **Reedsy** to draft and format this story.

### **Title: [Working Title]**
- **Word Count**: 5,000–10,000 words

#### **1. Introduction (500–1,000 words)**
- **Purpose**: Set up the protagonist and sci-fi setting.
- **What Happens**:
  - Meet Jax, a freelance pilot, in their daily grind (e.g., haggling at a spaceport).
  - Highlight a sci-fi element (e.g., alien tech or interstellar travel).
- **Reedsy Tip**: Use Reedsy’s clean interface to write this scene, setting writing goals to hit your word count.
- **Example Scene**: Jax negotiates a deal in a bustling spaceport bar, showcasing their wit.

#### **2. The Mission/Problem (1,000–2,000 words)**
- **Purpose**: Introduce the book’s central conflict.
- **What Happens**:
  - Jax accepts a job (e.g., delivering a sealed crate) with a mysterious twist.
  - Foreshadow trouble to build tension.
- **Reedsy Tip**: Import your draft into Reedsy from a .docx file if you start elsewhere, then organize it into chapters.
- **Example Scene**: A shady client hires Jax for a “no questions” delivery to a distant moon.

#### **3. Rising Action (2,000–3,000 words)**
- **Purpose**: Escalate stakes and expand the world.
- **What Happens**:
  - Challenges emerge (e.g., pirates attack, or the crate emits a signal).
  - Introduce a recurring character (e.g., a mechanic).
- **Reedsy Tip**: Use Reedsy’s collaboration feature to brainstorm with a friend or beta reader if needed.
- **Example Scene**: Pirates chase Jax, who opens the crate and finds a strange device.

#### **4. Climax (1,000–2,000 words)**
- **Purpose**: Resolve the conflict with a high-stakes moment.
- **What Happens**:
  - Jax confronts the mission’s truth (e.g., the device is an AI) and decides its fate.
- **Reedsy Tip**: Format the action with Reedsy’s tools (e.g., scene breaks) for a polished look.
- **Example Scene**: Jax uses the AI to fend off pirates, then chooses to destroy or keep it.

#### **5. Conclusion (500–1,000 words)**
- **Purpose**: Wrap up the story and tease the series.
- **What Happens**:
  - The job ends, but a hint (e.g., a message about Jax’s past) sets up Book 2.
- **Reedsy Tip**: Export to EPUB and PDF in Reedsy for Draft2Digital prep, ensuring front/back matter is set.
- **Example Scene**: Jax gets paid but finds a cryptic note hinting at a bigger mystery.
