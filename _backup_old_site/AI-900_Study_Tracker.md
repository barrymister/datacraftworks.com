## Domain 1: AI Workloads and Considerations

1. [ ] Understand common AI workloads: Computer Vision, NLP, Conversational AI
- Description:  
  AI workloads refer to specific types of tasks or applications where AI can be applied.  
  - Computer Vision involves analyzing and interpreting visual data (images, videos) to identify objects, faces, or patterns.  
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on understanding, generating, and analyzing human language (text or speech).  
  - Conversational AI builds systems that can interact with users in natural language, such as chatbots or virtual assistants.
2. [ ] Learn about Image Classification
- Description:  
  Image classification is a common computer vision task where an AI model assigns a label to an image based on its content. For example, identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog. Pre-built models in Azure’s Computer Vision API can handle standard image classification, while Azure Custom Vision allows you to train models on custom datasets.
3. [ ] Learn about Object Detection
- Description:  
  Object detection goes beyond image classification by not only identifying objects in an image but also locating them using bounding boxes. It is commonly used in security systems (e.g., detecting intruders) and autonomous vehicles (e.g., detecting pedestrians or other cars).
4. [ ] Learn about Face Recognition
- Description:  
  Face recognition involves detecting faces in images or videos and identifying or verifying them. Azure Face API provides pre-trained models for tasks like detecting emotions, age, and identity verification. It is widely used in security systems and user authentication applications.
5. [ ] Understand types of AI: Narrow AI, General AI, Applied AI
- Description:  
  - Narrow AI (Weak AI): AI systems designed for specific tasks, such as voice assistants or image recognition. These systems cannot generalize tasks beyond what they are trained for.  
  - General AI (Strong AI): A theoretical form of AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can do. It remains a goal in AI research but has not been achieved.  
  - Applied AI: The practical implementation of AI systems in real-world scenarios, such as healthcare diagnosis, predictive maintenance, or fraud detection.
6. [ ] Explore examples and limitations of Narrow AI
- Description:  
  Narrow AI excels at specialized tasks but cannot adapt beyond its programming. Examples include spam filters, recommendation systems, and virtual assistants. The main limitation is that these systems cannot handle tasks outside their training domain, unlike human intelligence.
7. [ ] Understand the concept of General AI
- Description:  
  General AI refers to machines that possess the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. Unlike Narrow AI, which is task-specific, General AI would have broad capabilities, including reasoning, problem-solving, and learning in any environment without human intervention.
8. [ ] Learn about practical applications of Applied AI
- Description:  
  Applied AI involves deploying AI solutions to solve real-world problems. Examples include:  
  - Healthcare: AI-driven diagnosis systems.  
  - Finance: Fraud detection and risk management.  
  - Transportation: Autonomous driving and traffic optimization.
9. [ ] Study responsible AI principles: Fairness, Privacy, Reliability, Transparency
- Description:  
  Responsible AI ensures that AI systems operate ethically and do not cause harm. Key principles include:  
  - Fairness: Avoiding bias in AI models to ensure fair outcomes.  
  - Privacy: Ensuring that data used by AI systems is protected and complies with regulations.  
  - Reliability: Ensuring that AI systems perform consistently across different conditions.  
  - Transparency: Providing clear explanations of AI decisions to users and stakeholders.
10. [ ] Learn techniques for mitigating bias in AI
- Description:  
  Bias in AI occurs when models produce unfair outcomes due to biased data or algorithms. Techniques for mitigating bias include:  
  - Using diverse and representative datasets.  
  - Regularly auditing models for fairness.  
  - Applying fairness-aware algorithms.
11. [ ] Understand data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR)
- Description:  
  Data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), set guidelines for collecting, processing, and storing personal data. When building AI systems, it is essential to ensure compliance with these regulations by anonymizing or encrypting sensitive data.
12. [ ] Learn about explainability and interpretability in AI models
- Description:  
  Explainability and interpretability are crucial for ensuring trust in AI systems.  
  - Explainability: The ability to explain how an AI model makes decisions (e.g., using SHAP or LIME to show feature importance).  
  - Interpretability: The degree to which a human can understand the inner workings of a model. Ensuring that users understand AI behavior is key for adoption and accountability.
