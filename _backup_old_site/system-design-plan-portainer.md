# **System Design Plan**

## **Overview**
Portainer provides a centralized, web-based UI to manage Docker containers across your infrastructure, significantly simplifying deployment and monitoring.

---

## **System Components**
1. **Proxmox Host (`pve`)**
   - Manages all virtualized environments and LXC containers.
   - Provides resources and network configurations for the LXC containers.

2. **LXC Container for Portainer (`portainer-lxc`)**
   - **Purpose**: Hosts Portainer, which will be used to deploy and manage Docker containers.
   - **Resources**:
     - 2 CPU cores
     - 4GB RAM
     - 20GB Disk
     - Nested virtualization enabled (`nesting=1`)
     - DHCP network configuration via `vmbr0` bridge

3. **Docker Containers Managed by Portainer**
   - **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from the Proxmox host and other targets.
   - **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics collected by Prometheus.
   - **Proxmox Exporter**: Exposes Proxmox metrics for Prometheus.

---

## **Deployment Plan**
### **Step 1: Create LXC Container for Portainer**
- Use Proxmox CLI to create an Ubuntu-based LXC container with the following specifications:
  - **Hostname**: `portainer-lxc`
  - **Resources**: 4GB RAM, 2 CPUs, 20GB disk.
  - **Networking**: DHCP via `vmbr0` bridge.
  - **Nested Virtualization**: Enabled for Docker support.

### **Step 2: Install Docker in Portainer LXC**
- Install Docker in the LXC container to support containerized workloads.

### **Step 3: Deploy Portainer in the LXC Container**
- Deploy Portainer as a Docker container within the LXC container.
- Access the Portainer web UI via `https://<LXC_IP>:9443`.

### **Step 4: Use Portainer to Deploy and Manage Containers**
- Use Portainer to deploy the following Docker containers:
  - **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from the Proxmox host.
  - **Grafana**: Displays visualizations using metrics from Prometheus.
  - **Proxmox Exporter**: Exposes metrics for Prometheus.

### **Step 5: Integrate Prometheus and Grafana**
- Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Proxmox Exporter.
- Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
- Use prebuilt or custom Grafana dashboards to monitor Proxmox.

---

## **Benefits**
1. **Simplified Management**:
   - Portainer provides an intuitive UI, reducing the need for complex automation scripts.
2. **Centralized Control**:
   - All Docker containers are managed in one place.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Easily expand the system by deploying additional containers or integrating multiple Docker environments.

---

## **Future Plans**
- Extend Portainer to manage multiple Proxmox nodes as you expand your infrastructure.
- Add reverse proxies (e.g., Traefik or Nginx Proxy Manager) to enhance security and flexibility.
- Explore advanced monitoring setups using additional Grafana dashboards or other metrics sources.
