| **Assignment**    | Assigns a value to a variable.                                                                                | `x = 10`                                         | Uses the `=` operator to store a value in a variable.                                                                  |
| **Augmented Assignment** | Combines an arithmetic operation with assignment.                                                            | `x += 5`                                         | Short form for `x = x + 5`. Similar operators include `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`.                                      |
| **Expression**    | A combination of values, variables, and operators that produces a result.                                      | `y = x + 2 * 3`                                  | Python evaluates the expression and assigns the result to `y`.                                                        |
| **Print**         | Outputs a message or value to the console.                                                                     | `print("Hello World")`                           | The `print()` function is used to display output.                                                                      |

| **Return**        | Exits a function and optionally returns a value.                                                               | `def add(x, y): return x + y`                   | Used to send a result back to the caller of a function.                                                                |
